# Backing Up Custom Reports
We strongly advise customers to always backup their custom reports before performing any in-place upgrades. Failure to do so could result in the loss of your custom reports!


**Prerequisites:**

1. The user executing these steps should be an administrator of the BI for SCCM workspace(s).
1. A second install of BI for SCCM to be used as a backup workspace. You do not need to configure the dataset parameters; this workspace is simply a placeholder to store a copy of your custom reports.
