# How to Install Custom Power BI Templates
### Introduction to BI for Intune Custom Templates


Welcome to an exciting addition to the BI for Intune ecosystem! At PowerStacks, we are dedicated to providing innovative solutions that elevate your Microsoft Intune reporting experience. With BI for Intune, our game-changing Power BI template app available on Microsoft AppSource, we’ve made it easier than ever to access, share, and install comprehensive Intune reports.

Now, we’re taking things a step further by introducing a GitHub repository to host additional custom report templates. This new initiative is designed to bring you an expanding collection of specialized reports, such as KPI dashboards, support desk analytics, and other purpose-driven insights that go beyond the default templates included with BI for Intune. These templates are crafted to save you time and effort while delivering unique perspectives tailored to your organizational needs.

In addition to accessing our curated templates, you’ll have the opportunity to collaborate with the broader Intune and PowerStacks communities. We encourage our customers to contribute their own templates to the repository, fostering a space for shared knowledge and innovation.

Please note that these custom templates are provided "as-is," without warranty or formal support. This allows us to keep this repository a dynamic and collaborative resource for everyone involved.

We’re thrilled to offer this new way to enhance your BI for Intune experience and look forward to seeing how these templates help you unlock even greater value from your Intune data. Let’s get started!

###### Side Note:

For the best experience, we advise that you edit custom templates exclusively in Power BI Desktop and maintain a local backup of your changes as a .pbix file on your computer. While not mandatory, this practice helps prevent conflicting versions of your reports that can arise from making edits in both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service, which can be confusing.
